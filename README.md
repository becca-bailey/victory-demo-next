This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Before you run the development server, you will need to make sure the file paths for victory, react, and react-dom are correct in package.json so you can use your local Victory repository. 

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Running in Production

To demo in production: 

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
